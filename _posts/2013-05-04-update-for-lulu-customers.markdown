We wanted to give a free PDF version of the book to those who bought from the [Lulu](http://www.lulu.com/shop/mike-bain-and-ryan-boucher-and-ashley-rollke/what-you-need-to-know-about-dates-and-times-in-computing/paperback/product-20950623.html). On publication though, we discovered that Lulu gives us absolutely no information about our readers aside from a 'number sold' count. We are now making use of the thank you note Lulu can email new readers and let them know that they can get a PDF version. We still get no information about who buys the book but at least they get an email letting them know the PDF copy if available.

This doesn't help anyone that has already bought the physical print. If you bought a copy of our book from Lulu and would like a PDF version, please email us at [shop@cromulent-publishing.com](mailto:shop@cromulent-publishing.com).

If you want a buy a PDF copy, then head right over to our [online shop](http://shop.cromulent-publishing.com/products/what-you-need-to-know-about-dates-and-times-in-computing) and get your personalised one.
