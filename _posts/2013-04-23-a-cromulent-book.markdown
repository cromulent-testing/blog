*Are you unsure if sleeping a thread is the best way to get tomorrow's date? Have you wasted your leap seconds and leap days dealing with leap issues? Are you getting paid correctly during 27 fortnight years? If you answered yes to any of these questions, or any of the other relevant questions that I haven't asked yet, then I've got simple, easy-to-read, solution for you. The Cromulent Guide: What you need to know about dates and times in computing.*

We've written a book called 'What you need to know about dates and times in computing'. As you can probably tell by the title, this book explains what you need to know about dates and times in computing. Its sole purpose is to quickly get you up to speed on this ubiquitous and commonly misunderstood topic.

I highly recommend you pick up a [pdf copy (only $3.5)](http://cromulent-publishing.myshopify.com/products/what-you-need-to-know-about-dates-and-times-in-computing) or, if you like to read something made from wood, [physical copies](http://www.lulu.com/shop/mike-bain-and-ryan-boucher-and-ashley-rollke/what-you-need-to-know-about-dates-and-times-in-computing/paperback/product-20950623.html) are available (at least $9... as some people see the price as $10.22). 

If you know someone who needs a little help with dates and times, then you can send them this link: [http://cromulent-publishing.com/](http://cromulent-publishing.com/)

The book isn't just for devs or testers. It got useful content, history and advice for analyst, uxers and front-end devs.
