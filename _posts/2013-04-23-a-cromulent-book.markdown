We've written a book called What You Need to Know About Dates and Times in Computing. As you can probably tell by the title, this book explains what you need to know about dates and times in computing. We’ve written it to help get you quickly up to speed on this important yet commonly misunderstood topic.

We would like you to buy a DRM free copy. It’s available at [http://cromulent-publishing.com/](http://cromulent-publishing.com/) as a pdf or if you like to read something made of wood, a physical copy is also available.

The book is 108 pages in length, contains pictures and is broken into the following parts:

- Why are dates and times so complicated?
- Key concepts e.g. *What is a point in time?, Time zones, Daylight saving time, UTC, Calendars and Leap years*
- Dealing with user input e.g. *Getting a date from a user, Getting the time from a user and Recurring events*
- Under the hood e.g. *Test automation, Converting time units, Getting to a second date, What if multiple date constructs are used?, Understanding the limits of time, Optionality and Sorting Dates*
