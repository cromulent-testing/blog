Testing something works correctly (technical correctness) is all well and good, but testing meaning (semantic correctness) is the mark of a true tester. Without it, you’re not much more than a glorified developer. 

A lot of projects do the wrong thing correctly. Here are some common semantic problems expressed using a progressively strained _Star Wars_ metaphor. 

You’re feeling nostalgic and ask a friend to put on a _Star Wars_ movie, they put on episode one, _The Phantom Menace_. While technically correct, it is a _Star Wars_ movie, it isn’t what you meant, it was semantically wrong. 

Problem: No shared understanding of what '*Star Wars*' means. 

You clarify by saying, “[Noooooo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&v=WWaLxFIVX1s), put the first _Star Wars_ episode on” the friend stares at you confused and says “we’re watching it”. 

Problem: the meaning of the first _Star Wars_ episode has evolved over time, does it mean episode 4, the first movie? Or episode 1, the first prequel? Your friend grew up in a different time, they may even like Jar Jar. 

You’ve finished your _Star Wars_ marathon, your friend says. “lets watch another _Star Wars_ film” and puts on _Caravan of Courage_. Neither of you enjoy the film because it’s not a _Star Wars_ film. It’s simply set in the _Star Wars_ universe. 

Problem: In this case you both had a shared understanding, it was just wrong. So very wrong.
