Even without testers on the team, you still need to test, or your customers will.

Here are some ways the team can help fill the gap:

Right at the start:
 - Follow work flows until it’s understood what needs to be done. [Swim lanes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swim_lane) help.
 - Think edge cases. Do they reveal new scope or change the design?
 - Find out why you’re doing what you’re doing
 - Remember where similar projects have gone wrong. Appear smart by telling others as if you just thought of it.


Before people start [coding](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5jGvSfCRDjY/TxgU9VUwLCI/AAAAAAAAAIM/ERK2V8i7VHY/s400/Programming.gif):
 - What’s the least you can do to responsibly meet the requirements?
 - Draw the possible paths, what happens at the end of each one?
 - What assumptions are you making? How can you [challenge](http://cromulent-testing.com/2011/09/22/challenging-assumptions.html) them?
 - How will you know when you’re done?


Testing stuff works during and afterwards:
 - [Moar](http://img.izismile.com/img/img3/20100316/moar_23.jpg) automation. Developers rock at this.
 - Run a tight ship; [check your own work](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKJsSPATDLY) as you go
 - Collaborate with your colleagues. Let them see your tests. Do handovers.
 - Rotate, it’s best if someone else tests your work

Go for coffee and discuss how to test tricky problems. Work as a team. Share ideas. Get in there and have a good time. We still test because it’s fun.
